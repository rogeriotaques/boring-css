# The Boring CSS

A [BEM](https://getbem.com/) based set of classes to style your pages in an authentic way.

It is just another boring, and opinionated, CSS styling library, by [RogÃ©rio Taques](https://x.com/rogeriotaques).

It's not a framework, does not have a grid system, and it has a very limited number of components. But it is still very cool ðŸ˜Ž and helps you building visually attractive UIs for your website or web application with peace of mind.

But, it supports dark mode ðŸŒ™ by default. ðŸ¤©

### Do you need a grid system?

If you need a grid system, you can use [Simple Grid](https://simplegrid.io/), as it is lightweight and very easy to use. By the way, you can find a slightly modified version of it, cleaned up to remove anything not related to the grid, in this repository as [`simple-grid.css`](./simple-grid.css).
